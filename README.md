# RecRoomArchiveProject
## What is it?
The RecRoom Archive Project is a project to create a program that can automatically patch and run a server for any **POSSIBLE** old Rec Room build (ps 2024 builds are impossible due to encrypted metadata, sorry!)

## Where can I download?
Downloads for the program currently arent avalible, however I plan to make them avalible shortly with constant updates adding more and more support for more and more builds!

All downloads will be found DIRECTLY on this github with information how to download :)

## How do you know EVERY build will work?
Well, I will test and make specific adjustments as necessary to make sure EVERY build is atleast possible to play! Features will be limited as these are locally hosted servers.

## Will it be easy to play?
There will be a nice user-friendly GUI in the program to make it quick and easy for anybody to move through!

## Can I play on quest?
Unfortunately, this is exclusive to PC, all builds will only be avalible to pc :(
